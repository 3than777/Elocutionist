/**
 * AI Interview Coach Backend - Controllers Index
 * 
 * This file serves as the central export point for all controller modules.
 * Controllers handle business logic and coordinate between routes, services, and models.
 * They implement the separation of concerns principle by keeping route handlers clean.
 * 
 * Controller Organization:
 * - AuthController - User authentication, registration, and session management
 * - InterviewController - Interview creation, management, and question generation
 * - SessionController - Session recording, transcript management, and playback
 * - FeedbackController - AI feedback generation and performance analysis
 * 
 * Design Principles:
 * - Functional programming patterns over classes
 * - Dependency injection for services (passed as parameters)
 * - Proper error handling with try-catch blocks
 * - Consistent response format across all controllers
 * - Input validation before processing
 * 
 * Error Handling:
 * - All controller functions wrapped in try-catch blocks
 * - Proper HTTP status codes returned
 * - User-friendly error messages without exposing internals
 * - Detailed error logging for debugging
 *

// Example future structure:
// export { default as authController } from './auth.controller';
// export { default as interviewController } from './interview.controller';
// export { default as sessionController } from './session.controller';
