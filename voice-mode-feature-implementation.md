# Voice Mode Feature Implementation - Task List

## Project Overview

The Voice Mode feature will allow users to switch from typing to speaking during their AI interview practice sessions. Users will have a toggle to enable voice mode, where they can speak their responses (speech-to-text) and hear the AI's responses spoken back to them (text-to-speech). This feature uses the Web Speech API for speech recognition and synthesis, with fallbacks and error handling for browser compatibility.
