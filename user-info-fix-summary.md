# User Info File Fix Summary

## Problem
The uploaded user_info file was not being included in AI prompts because:
1. Files were loaded on component mount before user authentication
2. The upload context was not reloading files when the user logged in
3. No way to manually refresh files if needed

## Solutions Applied

### 1. User-Aware Upload Context
- Modified `UploadProvider` to accept a `user` prop from App component
- Files now reload automatically when user logs in
- Files are cleared when user logs out

### 2. Authentication Flow Improvements
- Token is now included in the user object for consistent access
- Better logging throughout the authentication process
- Token validation before attempting to load files

### 3. Debug Features Added
- **Refresh Files button**: Manually reload uploaded files
- **Debug Files button**: Check what files are in the database
- Extensive console logging to track the flow

### 4. PowerShell Commands Fixed
For Windows PowerShell, use semicolons instead of &&:
```powershell
# Backend
cd C:\Users\ethanli\Desktop\crewd; npm run dev

# Frontend (in new terminal)
cd C:\Users\ethanli\Desktop\crewd\dreamcollege-frontend; npm run dev
```

## How to Test

1. **Start both servers** using the PowerShell commands above

2. **Open browser** to http://localhost:5173 with DevTools Console open

3. **Login** to your account

4. **Click "Refresh Files"** button to manually load your uploaded files

5. **Check console** for these logs:
   - `[UploadProvider] User authenticated, loading uploaded files...`
   - `[loadUploadedFiles] Loaded files: X`
   - `Upload context files: Array(X)` (should show your files)

6. **Send a test message** like "What's my name?"
   - Make sure "Use uploaded content" is checked
   - Watch backend logs for file integration

## What You Should See

### In Browser Console:
- User authentication logs
- File loading confirmation
- Upload context showing your files
- Content metadata when sending messages

### In Backend Terminal:
- User authenticated with ID
- Files found and loaded
- Content successfully added to chat context

## If Still Not Working

1. **Click "Debug Files"** to verify files are in database
2. **Check file status** - should be "completed" not "processing"
3. **Try re-uploading** the user_info file
4. **Clear browser cache** and localStorage, then login again

The key fix was making the upload context reload files when you login, rather than only loading once on app startup.
